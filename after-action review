After-action review
September 2025 PAARA in the Park
**********************

SHADE!!!  next time

More irons and battery.  Battery power was good, didn't need generator.   USB irons?  
Can get ordinary 20w irons from Jameco for less than $10

Cord management

we used 2 tables for about 15 people.   Did not need extra tables and chairs.

hard to hear the intro -- should do the huddle as planned, or mic up and amplify (prefer this)

A couple of pairs of pliers was enough

Didn't need alcohol

Did do some rework.   Sucker and wick were good to have on hand.    However coaches need to be shown the
"big blob of solder" trick for easily desoldering sturdy through-hole components. Sucker and wick then are
for cleanup.


More things that went well

Detailed planning, especially given that this was the first time
Timing the build ahead of time
A couple of pre-planning meetings were key including reconnaissance of the location.
Great core team (Clark, Margaret, Connie) 
Telling people to show up at 10 but planning for signing and seating activity for the first 10 min
Jameco kit was the right scope and level of complexity.  Kit had great instructions, board well-marked
Activity fit comfortably in the time allotted
Coaches knew what they were doing and were very helpful and friendly
Not handing out the kit right away was good; checklist and structured steps w/coach checking good
Being alert to people ignoring instructions, redirecting them to RTFM
how-to-do-it pictures were good
